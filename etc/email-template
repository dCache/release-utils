Dear dCache admins,

We have made the latest bug-fix RELEASES, which ARE VERSION_LIST.  The
packages may be downloaded from the usual locations and the release notes
for EACH series have been updated.

As usual, please examine the release notes carefully to understand
whether you need to upgrade your dCache instance.

Cheers,

Marina
